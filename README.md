# Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company using Excel. The dataset was cleaned and analyzed by creating pivot tables and charts to identify key patterns and factors contributing to customer churn.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, leading to revenue loss. Understanding the reasons behind churn can help businesses retain customers and improve services.

## Methodology
• Data Cleaning:
o Removed inconsistencies using Find and Replace.
o Formatted numerical values (e.g., converting decimals to integers).
o Split combined columns (e.g., Contract Type & Payment Method).
o Categorized account length into groups (New, Mid, Long-term customers).

• Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables & Charts:
o Built Pivot Tables to analyze churn patterns.
o Developed Pivot Charts to present insights clearly and support decisionmaking.

## Key Insights
• Contract Type Impact:
o The majority of churned customers (1,570) had month-to-month contracts, while very few had longer-term contracts.

• Payment Method Influence:
o Customers using direct debit (1,270) churned the most, whereas paper check users had the least churn (140).

• Top Reasons for Churn:
o The main reason for churn was competitor influence (801), followed by customer attitude and dissatisfaction.

• Churn by Age Group:
o The highest churn occurred in the 40-49 age group (328), followed by the 19-29 age group (293). The lowest churn was observed in the 80+ age group (88).

• Customer Group Churn:
o A large majority of churned customers (1,688) were not part of any specific group.

• Gender Distribution:
o Churn is evenly distributed between male and female customers (50% each).

• Device Protection & Online Backup:
o Customers without device protection and online backup had a higher churn rate (1,262) compared to those with it (525).

• Top Churned States:
o The highest churn occurred in WV, OH, OR, AL, and MD, with WV leading (57).

• Churn by Account Length:
o New customers (0-1 year) exhibited the highest churn (987), while long-term customers (4+ years) had the lowest churn (205).

• Impact of International Plan:
o Customers without international plans (1,625) had a higher churn rate than those with it (162).

• Impact of Unlimited Data Plan:
o Customers with unlimited data plans (1,435) had a significantly higher churn rate compared to those without it (352).

## Suggestions
1. Offer attractive discounts or benefits to customers who switch from month-tomonth contracts to annual contracts.
2. Provide small discounts or rewards for customers using paper checks, as direct debit users tend to churn more.
3. Improve customer service and launch competitor-matching offers to address dissatisfaction and competitor influence.
4. Encourage group/family plans with added benefits to reduce churn among solo customers.
5. Since churn is equal across genders, prioritize other key factors such as contract type, payment method, and service quality to reduce overall churn.
6. Actively promote international plans and device protection/online backup services with trial periods, flexible options, and educational resources to demonstrate their value.
7. Implement a "First Year Care" program offering extra support and benefits for new customers during their critical first year.
8. Target the states with the highest churn (WV, OH, OR, AL, MD) with localized offers and better customer service.
9. Offer special plans for different age groups, such as family/work deals for the 40-49 age group and more affordable plans for the 19-29 age group.
10. Review and optimize unlimited data plan pricing and features to ensure better value for customers.
